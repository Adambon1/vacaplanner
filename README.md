Title: Vacation Planner

the frontend of the project is a react project that was built on visual studio code. I used my knowledge of reac to design a front end and make requests to the backend i created in the other repository.

To run the project you can open the src code in something like visual studio code and enter 'npm start'

building the frontend i was faced with many challenges when it comes to get the requests to work, unfortunately i was not fully functional requests however i did my best. Another that i struggled with, that i was able to fix was the map that you see on the website. i wasn't able to get a topojson file to work so i did some research and found out that i could simply use a url which is what i ended up doing.

The wya the website is designed is, for a user to enter their destination and have it popup below where they input it. Then the user would make a list of tasks they need to do in order to organize themselves to have a successful trip. The tasks would form a list below the input boxes and then once complete they can press on the task and remove it so that they know the task is done. Then at the end the user can rate their experience on the trip the planned for themselves.

There is a relationship between the destination that user decides and the tasks that the user must complete in order to go have a successful vacation.
